## About Me
My research interests are generally in operating systems and distributed systems. Specifically, I am interested in tackling the sustainability of datacenter-scale computing with a focus on improving a system's overall performance and energy efficiency. Towards this, I work in the interface between software and hardware and employ systems optimizations and machine learning techniques to improve upon existing software-hardware heuristics. 

Prior to Hamilton College, I earned my PhD and worked as a postdoctoral associate at Boston University. I have also worked as a researcher for Red Hat and as an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) Fellow in the Division of Imaging and Applied Mathematics at the Food and Drug Administration. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy reading poetry, visiting art museums, taking care of plants, snowboarding, and tinkering with small microcontrollers.
