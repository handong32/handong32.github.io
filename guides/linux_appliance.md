# Building Custom Linux Appliances

## Motivation
Linux appliances are a relatively old idea (https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa2000/full_papers/shaffer/shaffer_html/index.html), often understood as a self-contained system image containing *just enough* software and operating systems support to run a single application. Typically, they are built by system administrators to reduce system maintenance and improve ease of deployment. However, these appliances are equally useful for anyone interested in benchmarking the Linux kernel while ensuring experimental stability with minimal system noise. 

As recently discussed in https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/musings-operating-systems-research, almost all modern OS research is conducted on Linux; which typically implies a Linux flavor such as Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. However, it is also not always clear how much effort researchers have taken to remove as many extraneous processes and kernel modules as possible to ensure a clean and stable Linux environment. For example, my Asus Ultrabook running Ubuntu 20.04 with Linux-5.11.0 idles with **231 processes** and **123 kernel modules** loaded. On the same laptop which I got it to run a custom built Linux-5.5.0 kernel and a custom initramfs; idles with **80 processes** and **0 kernel modules** loaded.

Furthermore in a recent paper published in SOSP'19: "An Analysis of Performance Evolution of Linux’s Core Operations", the authors presented application performance impacts that are caused by Linux's configuration setup, further, they demonstrated how disabling certain features that were added recently for security can result in significant performance improvements. This also motivates the overall premise of how much of Linux's default configuration does a kernel really need to be *functional* 

I have also followed their suggestions and built a Linux-5.4.0 kernel with a config file that is less than 50% the length of the Linux-5.11.0 kernel and I have also booted this custom kernel on my laptop.
