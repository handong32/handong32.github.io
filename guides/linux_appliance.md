# Building Custom Linux Appliances

## Why
Linux appliances are a relatively old [idea](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa2000/full_papers/shaffer/shaffer_html/index.html), often understood as a self-contained system image containing *just enough* software and operating systems support to run a single application. Typically, they are built by system administrators to reduce system maintenance and improve ease of deployment. However, these appliances are equally useful for anyone interested in benchmarking the Linux kernel while ensuring experimental stability and minimal system noise.
