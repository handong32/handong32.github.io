# Building Custom Linux Appliances

## Motivation
Linux appliances are a relatively old idea (https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa2000/full_papers/shaffer/shaffer_html/index.html), often understood as a self-contained system image containing *just enough* software and operating systems support to run a single application. Typically, they are built by system administrators to reduce system maintenance and improve ease of deployment. However, these appliances are equally useful for anyone interested in benchmarking the Linux kernel while ensuring experimental stability with minimal system noise. 

As recently discussed in https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/musings-operating-systems-research, almost all modern OS research is conducted on Linux; which typically implies a Linux flavor such as Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. However, it is also not always clear how much effort researchers have taken to remove as many extraneous processes and kernel modules as possible to ensure a clean and stable Linux environment. For example, my Asus Ultrabook running Ubuntu 20.04 with Linux-5.11.0 idles with **231 processes** and **123 kernel modules** loaded. On the same laptop which I got it to run a custom built Linux-5.5.0 kernel and a custom initramfs; idles with **80 processes** and **0 kernel modules** loaded.

Furthermore in a recent paper published in SOSP'19: "An Analysis of Performance Evolution of Linuxâ€™s Core Operations", the authors demonstrated how Linux's configuration settings can have significant performance impacts on an application. This also motivates the overall premise of how much of Linux's default configuration does a kernel really need to be *functional* and how much complexity can thus be stripped out to run a minimum set of binaries? For example, following suggestions in this paper, I was able to build and boot a Linux-5.4.0 kernel with a custom config file that is less than 50% the length of a default Linux configuration.

Beyond these, another side benefit of a custom Linux appliance is that the root filesystem is loaded as a RAM disk by default; which is another positive for researchers who want to minimize system noise from disk paging as all executables are now run out from memory. Obviously, other considerations are needed should the experiments require data from a external storage device.

## Goals
There are many tutorials online to build your own Linux kernel and initramfs, however, their usecases are typically too general and the steps involved can be quite complex. This tutorial will demonstrate that it is infact surprsingly easy to get a barebones Linux up and running that is ready to execute some simple binaries. The tutorial will cover the specific use-cases of how to build Linux appliances, how to boot them, and how this can help enable experimental automation, with a focus on performance and system stability. 

Concretely, here are the following steps in this tutorial towards this goal:

1. Steps to create an initramfs
2. Build a basic Linux kernel
3. How to get simple binaries to run
4. How to boot appliance via GRUB
5. How to get device drivers working
6. Modiyfing /init for experiments
7. Booting via PXEBOOT protocol in a local network

## Preparation
Before we embark on this journey, here's a general breakdown of what is required on your end. First, you should have a testing computer that you will be booting the Linux appliance on and you should have an existing Linux flavor already installed on the computer, this can be Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. Having a pre-existing OS on your testing machine is important because you want to make sure you are in a state where the binary you intend to run is infact runnable and it can also be used to install additional packages that you may need. The implication here is also that the kernel used for the Linux appliance should be simiarly versioned as the existing OS to ensure system library compatibility, details of this will be covered in the Linux kernel section below.

## Steps to create an initramfs
The steps below are mainly draw from the work done by https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/. We will be skipping all the steps to get the cross compilers and systems packages installed and running, instead, this tutorial demonstrates how binaries can be made runnable simply by copying over needed system libraries from the already installed OS. 

### 1. Setup working environment
Open up a terminal and log in to the `root` user by running `sudo -s`. Next, export the name for the initramfs for where you will be creating the directory by running `export LFS=~/initfs`. Check that it has been setup correctly by running `echo $LFS`. You might also want to put the `export LFS=~/initfs` command into the `.bashrc` file of the `root` user so that it gets set automatically.

### 2. Create overall directory structure
```
mkdir -pv $LFS
mkdir -pv $LFS/{etc,var} $LFS/usr/{bin,lib,sbin}

for i in bin lib sbin; do
  ln -sv usr/$i $LFS/$i
done

case $(uname -m) in
  x86_64) mkdir -pv $LFS/lib64 ;;
esac

```

Now, we create the very important `/init` file which will be used to eventually drive experiments
```
 ## create an ini file (note: not using systemd)
cat > ${MYINIT}/init <<EOF
#!/bin/bash

set -x

export HOME=/root
export LOGNAME=root
export TERM=vt100
export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin
export ENV="HOME=\$HOME LOGNAME=\$LOGNAME TERM=\$TERM PATH=\$PATH"

# setup standard file system view
mount -t proc /proc /proc
mount -t sysfs /sys /sys

# take care of /dev 1) try using devtmpfs and devpts or 2) dev of exiting fs and devpts
if ! mount -t devtmpfs -o mode=0755 udev /dev; then
  # failed to mount devtmpfs
  # so add a few useful things if not already in file system
  echo "W: devtmpfs not available, falling back to tmpfs for /dev"
  [[ -e /dev/console ]] || mknod -m 0600 /dev/console c 5 1
  [[ -e /dev/null ]] || mknod /dev/null c 1 3
  [[ -e /dev/zero ]] || mknod /dev/zero c 1 5
  [[ -e /dev/random ]] || mknod /dev/random c 1 8
  [[ -e /dev/urandom ]] || mknod /dev/urandom c 1 9
fi 

[[ -e /dev/pts ]] || mkdir /dev/pts

mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts

# Some things don't work properly without /etc/mtab.
ln -sf /proc/mounts /etc/mtab

# if we get here then we might as well start a shell :-) 
/bin/bash

# if bash fails, shuts off machine
poweroff -f

EOF

## set permissions for init
chmod 755 ${MYINIT}/init
```

Next, we will compress the initramfs into a cpio format
```
## make sure you are inside the $MYINIT directory
cd ${MYINIT}
find . | cpio -o -H newc > ../${MYINIT}.cpio
```

## Getting simple Unix binaries to run
The `/init` created above is the first script is run to set up various Linux subsystems. Examining it, one can see that `#!/bin/bash` is the first program that is called, which provides an environment to run a basic shell. I will show an example of how to copy some utility binaries and its dependent libraries into the correct folders. The steps shown below will be completely manual but it can also be completely scriptable as well, however, that will be outside the scope of this tutorial.

For other binaries you intend to run, you'll want to build the binary statically in order to eliminate potential external library loading costs, however, should that be too troublesome, then the same steps below will be applied there too.

```
## From /init file above, we see that the following programs will be needed: bash, mount, echo, mkdir, ln, poweroff

## figure out where binary lives
ubuntu:~$ export MYBIN=bash
ubuntu:~$ which $MYBIN
/usr/bin/bash
ubuntu:~$ which $MYBIN | xargs -I '{}' dirname '{}'
/usr/bin

## get full path
export MYBIN_LOC=$(which $MYBIN)

## copy bash to correct directory in initramfs
ubuntu:~$ cp $MYBIN_LOC ${MYINIT}/usr/bin/

## ldd can tell us the system libraries the binary depends upon
ubuntu:~$ ldd $MYBIN_LOC
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff1a188000)
	libtinfo.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6 (0x00007fb088faa000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fb088fa4000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb088db2000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb089119000)

## Basically, we have to make sure we copy the correct libraries at the correct location in the new initramfs
## We can ignore linux-vdso.so.1 as the kernel provides it automatically: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html.

## simple scripting to get the necessary libraries
ubuntu:~$ ldd $MYBIN_LOC | grep "ld-linux" | awk '{print $1}'
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

ubuntu:~$ ldd $MYBIN_LOC | grep "=> /" | awk '{print $3}'
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6

## copy the libraries that bash depend on
ubuntu:~$ cp /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ${MYINIT}/lib64/
ubuntu:~$ cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6 ${MYINIT}/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
ubuntu:~$ cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 ${MYINIT}/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
ubuntu:~$ cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 ${MYINIT}/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
